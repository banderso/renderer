The renderer currently handles meshes that contain vertex, normal, texture coords,
elements, and material references. Need to abstract out the idea of an "object"
so that model-view matrices can be stored logically. Additionally object data, 
the above mentioned mesh values, needs to be read in through files instead of 
hard coded in the source. Research OBJ files or using JSON as the file format.

The objet structure should follow the component-entity system where an entity is
an ephemeral object, usually just an id, that is attached to components. Right now
things feel as though they shouldn't be too much work to be massaged into the 
desired structure.
